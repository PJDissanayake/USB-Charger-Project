# USB Charger PCB Design

![USB Charger PCB]()

This project contains the PCB design files for a USB charger inspired by Altium Education. The USB charger provides a reliable and efficient charging solution for various electronic devices, charging two devices simultaneously through dual USB ports. It requires a 12V input for operation.

## Features

- Dual USB output for charging two devices at once.
- Input voltage protection and current-limiting for safety.
- LED indicators for charging status and error notification.
- High-quality components for efficiency and durability.
